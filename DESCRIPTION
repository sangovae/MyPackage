Title: Vespa Invasion Vizualization
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sanne Govaert
Maintainer: Sanne Govaert <A.User@whereever.net>
Description: Produce a map or bar chart per year of known observations of Asian hornets (Vespa velutina) in Flanders. They typically want to filter this information on a year range.
    Create R code that allows:
    1. To define a year range (e.g. 2019-2021).
    2. To retrieve occurrences from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) for that year range of Vespa velutina in Flanders.
    3. To present the result as a map of observations.
    4. To present the result as a bar chart of observations per year.
    Your code should be documented and tested. Your code should be maintained on GitHub.
